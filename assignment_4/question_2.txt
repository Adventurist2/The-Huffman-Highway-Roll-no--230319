int arr[5]={2,8,18,34,5}; 
char ch[6]=”abcde”; 
cout<<arr<<endl; 
cout<<ch; 
What output will you get in each line(address is printed or something else)? Why so?

Both the statements will print the memory address of the first element stored in the respective arrays.
its because the name of the array is a pointer pointing to the first element of the array.
